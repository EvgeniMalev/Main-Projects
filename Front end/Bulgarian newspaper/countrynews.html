             <h2>Historic Castles Undergo Restoration in Bulgaria's Former Capitals</h2>
        <p>In a bid to preserve Bulgaria's rich cultural heritage, extensive restoration projects are underway in the ancient capitals of Pliska and Veliki Preslav. The majestic castles, once symbols of power and grandeur, had fallen into disrepair over the centuries. Pliska, the first capital of the First Bulgarian Empire, is witnessing the meticulous restoration of its imposing fortress walls and regal palaces. Archaeologists and preservationists work tirelessly to uncover the secrets of this historic site, shedding light on Bulgaria's early medieval history. Similarly, in Veliki Preslav, the medieval stronghold of Tsarevets undergoes a transformative restoration effort. Perched atop a hill overlooking the Yantra River, the fortress is being revitalized to its former glory, complete with reconstructed towers, fortified walls, and ceremonial halls. These ambitious restoration endeavors not only aim to revitalize Bulgaria's architectural treasures but also to revitalize national pride and cultural identity. The restored castles are set to become vibrant cultural hubs, attracting visitors from around the world and serving as a testament to Bulgaria's rich and storied past. The cultural imprint of the two capitals will also be attempted to be restored. Seven new important archaeological sites related to the two capitals are revealed. Over 30 academics in the field of historical sciences gathered at a historical conference.</p>
