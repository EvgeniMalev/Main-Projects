      <h2><u>Cold war years back</u></h2> 
      <p>The Cold War, spanning from the late 1940s to the early 1990s, marked a period of intense geopolitical tension between the United States and its allies in the Western bloc and the Soviet Union and its allies in the Eastern bloc. Characterized by ideological, economic, and military competition, it saw proxy wars, nuclear arms race, and espionage. Key events include the Berlin Airlift, Korean War, Cuban Missile Crisis, and the space race. The Cold War ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union, symbolized by the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, leading to a new era in global politics.</p>
