In this project, the focus is on a main page linked to several others. Eight pages are composed, 
one of which is indexed and refers the user to each of the other seven. Two of the pages except
.html and .css files contains a .js file. Various effects are presented in the web pages, such as: 
importing a video file, importing a audio file, displaying flowing text, 3d elements, buttons for
  displaying certain content and others.
